## Installation

Please check the official laravel installation guide for server requirements before you start. [Official Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/installation#installation)

Alternative installation is possible without local dependencies relying on [Docker](#docker). 
Follow the following steps to run the application

    git clone git@github.com:hexaorigintech/task

Switch to the repo folder
 cd task

Install all the dependencies using composer

    composer install
